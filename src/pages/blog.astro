    <p>As a strong believer in <a href='https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/'>Learning in Public</a> I try to both
      solidify my learning and share with others by writing about my experiences. I generally write about problems I
      come across and how I solved them. I'll occassionally also write about my personal experiences of making progress
      as a developer, and thoughts about how my experiences as a developer overlap with my previous experiences as a
      designer and teacher.</p>
    <p>If you spot an error, or have any comments, suggestions or questions about what I've written, please <a
        href='/contact'>contact me</a>.
      I'd love to hear from you.</p>
